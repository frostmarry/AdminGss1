# Compress Image

Compress your image without losing quality

## How to use

Clone this project inside the project that you want to use

```
composer require eihror/compress-image
```

Create variables to receive the elements

```
$file = 'koala.jpg'; //file that you wanna compress
$new_name_image = 'koala_mini'; //name of new file compressed
$quality = 60; // Value that I chose
$pngQuality = 9; // Exclusive for PNG files
$destination = 'content'; //This destination must be exist on your project
```

Create a new instance of a class

```
$image_compress = new Eihror\Compress\Compress($file, $new_name_image, $quality, $pngQuality, $destination);
```

And make the compression calling the function **compress_image**

```
$image_compress->compress_image();
```

This funtion will return only the name of new image compressed with your respective extension
